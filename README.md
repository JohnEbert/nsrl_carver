# nsrl_carver
Three BASH scripts (easily modified) to carve custom hashsets out of the NSRL RDS_Unified hashset. The example default is configured to carve all record codes and product file names for (~Windows 7 AND ~Operating System) type into a sub-hashset (and companion idx file) useful in tools like Autopsy.
